# Arduino-IR-Triggered-RGB-Light
A simple Arduino Uno project: an RGB LED turns on when an **IR proximity sensor** detects movement (e.g. under a desk), stays on for a few seconds, and then turns off automatically.   The microcontroller is put into **low-power sleep mode** and wakes up only on sensor trigger, saving energy.
